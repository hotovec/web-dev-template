    <p>Product icon design is inspired by the tactile and physical quality of material. Each icon is cut, folded, and lit as paper would be, but represented by simple graphic elements.
        Material Design icons are quite distinct from flat design icons. In Material Design language icons are limited by shape, geometry and icon anatomy (layers) constrains. Misconception: adding long shadows makes your icon “Material Design style”. Forget shadows, think of overall icon structure and appearance… </p>
